# Alpha Strike Custom Card Generator

This is used in tandem with MegaMek Lab to generate custom variants of mechs that might not be currenly avaliable in the current game or may not fit the play style that you're trying to go for. One of the main reasons that I wanted to make this program is because of the lack of special equipment on mechs that you can use in classic. C3, Stealth armor, ECM and other abilities are something that I felt was lacking from some mech variants that pidgeon holes you into playing a way that you may not want to.

For that reason, instead of just sitting here and complaining about it, I wanted to try to fix that and help rectify that to make Alpha Strike a much more enjoyable game with more customized gameplay.

## Requirements:

This is designed to work with MegaMek Lab which can be found here:

After completing your custom mech variant all you need to do is export the mech as text shown below:

After that step all you need to do is run the python script in your IDE of choice and then you can use the official Master Unit List to generate the official card:

Currently a work in-progress with the goal to have a UI that will spit out the card to your local drive with the correct values placed
